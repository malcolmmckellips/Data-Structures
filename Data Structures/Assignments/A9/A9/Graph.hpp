 This is the struct for each vertex in the graph.
 When you construct the shortest path between two vertices,

 Also, you will use the distance members in your shortest
 path implementations.  The ID member should be an index
 that is increased every time a vertex is added to the graph.
 The first vertex will have an ID equal to zero.
